title: React-router
---

Hey guys,     
Today when I started my task I encountered with need of routing in project. So, after a lot of googling I got to know about React-router which can be used to make a path to a page 
in SPA and it looks like we are using an app as it doesnt get loaded it just renders the component and shows it. It is a very good concept for routing and make our daily task easy. 
After that I started designing the bottom nav bar. I resolved some bugs after deploying it and encountered a serious bug, when I open a route by clicking a button on start page, it 
opens the main page but when I out its address in the url bar, it doesnt shows up instead it is showing 404 error. Same thing happens when I try to refresh the page. Indeed I got 
the fix from a senior but I would be trying it tomorrow. 
#### Goodbye
### Happy routes
