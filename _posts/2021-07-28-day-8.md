title: Day 8 - Custom react select dropdown
---
- ## Task
  * To create a custom select dropdown same as reaxt-select package.

Hey friends!!     
As I have stated in previous blogs that I made a clone of angular component ng-select in react but I was not
supposed to use any library in it.      
So, today my task was to complete this task and as far as I have done is implementation of logic. It took 
me a day long to code up the logics. Now, I am left with styling art which is going to be challenging. So, 
I have nothing much to write until I complete this task. So, I will wake up tomorrow early morning and try 
to get it done. It made me realise that it is very easy to simply include a package in your project rather 
than implementing it on your own. Though it is better to pace up things but only if you have implemented it 
on your own once in a while. So, I am gonna complete this task as soon as possible and then will let you 
all know about it. Tell then goodbye.     
#### Thank You
### Happy implementing ðŸ¤—
