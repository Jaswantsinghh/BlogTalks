- ## Task
  * Improvements in code.

## Namaste People!!
Today was a fine day, I am coding since two years but I never gave a glance at my coding pattern. I used to think that whatever code I have written it does not affect me in anyway 
if it is working fine and accomplishing the task. But if I explain this case comparing with daily life situation, consider the workspace where you work if it is unclean or dirty 
then it will affect your productivity whereas if it is clean and well organised it would definitely affect your productivity negitively.    
Hence, whenever we are coding a website, an app or anything, it is very important to have a well formatted clean code. If it is a big project then you need to have well organised 
file structure. You must follow uniformity throughout the code. Whenever you will look at your code in future or somebody else checks it then it would be easy to read. If proper 
documentation of every element of code is done then it would be more easy. It will save your time and will not frustrate you.     
**I was coding in the dark until I came into light of eslint.** I have already mentioned about eslint in my [previous blog](https://jaswantsinghh.github.io/BlogTalks//day-2). In that 
blog I have explained it in brief with it's installation guide.     
I changed the file structure of my project, combined some components which were to be used only once. I renamed variable names and followed camelCase naming for all. Restructured 
sass files. When I checked my code on [deepscan.io](https://deepscan.io) it rated my code as good. I was so satisfied with code after this. You should also definitely give a try to 
improving your code, it has a purpose in coding.
