title: Day 11 - Modal Window
---
Hey Guys!!!      
Today my day started and ended with designing modal window. More simple it seems more complicated it is. I thought it would take me a day to complete this task perhaps it took a day 
for modal window only but I would say it was fun. I learnt so many new concepts related to react and sass as well. You know it is so much frustrated when you are unable to see 
desired output of css on the screen but when the desired output is accomplished it is as much rewarding. Today, I got stuck at many places but thank god my mentor made me survive. 
Having a mentor in life not only guides you on the right path but also make it easy for you. So, I suggest all the reader to have mentors in their life and be someone's mentor too.   
Now I am so much tired and I am going to beg now.   
#### Signing off 
### Happy failing and learning ðŸ˜„
