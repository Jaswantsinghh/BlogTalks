title: Day 9 - `ng-select` clone
---

Hi Pals!
From so many days I am being struggling with `ng-select` clone and its one more day. Unfortunately, today too I was unable to complete the project but my learning is growing 
exponentially nowaday. I am getting much closer to react and getting to know new stuffs. Today, I implemented outside click thing, when we click outside the container, dropdown box 
closes automatically. I implemented it using custom react hook and useRef hook. It was amazing day. Its all about for the day, and you can check code in my github repository.     
#### Thank You
### Happy GrowingðŸŒ±
