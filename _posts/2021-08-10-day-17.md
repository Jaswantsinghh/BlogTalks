title: Day 17 - Hashrouter
---
Hey guys,     
I started my day today by looking for the solution of the bug of react-router. As I told you earlier I got its fix from one of my senior but I had'nt tried it yet. So, I opened the 
link and the fix I got was `HashRouter`. When I found it, I was so happy to see it work and it kinda motivated me. I am wondering how learning can never be 100%, we always have a 
bunch left to learn and more bugs we encounter more we get to learn. It seems to me like failing is more rewarding than winning. Anyways, after fixing this problem I started the work 
on the main page, designed the layout of the page, fixed the navBar at the bottom of the page but still there are a lot of alignment issues. I am leaving them for tomorrow and will 
start with a fresh mind. Until then goodbye, takecare.     
#### Thank You
