title: Day 3 - i18n translations
---
- ## Tasks:-
  * To resolve the issues commented on yesterday's merge request.
  * To do corrections in translation.json from a new bundle.         

Today, I continued my work on i18n module only. Yesterday, I commited few changes in translation.json and few modules as well and opened the merge request to the main repository. 
But I was unaware of some mistakes I made during my task. Fortunately these mistakes were highlighted by the lead and my work became much simple now.     
So, now I resolved the issues one by one. While using i18n module it is common that you may miss keywords in one language. I did the same mistake, I forget to put the keyword in
esp/translation.json after putting it in en/translation.json. After resolving all these issues, PR was merged to main repo.      

After that I got a new bundle of corrections to be done in translations file. I did those corrections and opened a merge request. So, I will wait till the PR get reviewed and approved. 
I hope no issue will come out after reviewing but if issues arises, I am ready to solve them and will let you know in tomorrow's blog.   
One more task given to me today was to learn about scss but due I can't miss the codeforce contest so I rescheduled learning scss and most probably I will do it in early morning
 tomorrow and will also let you explore it in tomorrow's blog. 
 #### Stay Tuned
 #### Thank You
 ### Happy translating :>
