title: Day 10 - Getting easy with ng-select clone
---

*Sat Sri Akal* lok'on!
Today I am in a very good mood, no you guessed it wrong I did'nt completed `ng-select` clone but I got full motivation that till tomorrow morning it will be done. Are you wondering 
how did it happen finally? I talked to my mentor on call today and I got solution to every problem I was facing in the clone. So, I today finalise evry functionality by ensuring 
it work same as that of original. Now I am left with a bit of styling and I am confident I will complete it by tomorrow. Hope you all are doing well, monsoon season is just started 
and I wanted you to take care of yourself and go outside with umbrella.     
#### Thank you Guys!
### Happy vibes üòÅ
