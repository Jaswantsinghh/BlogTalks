Hello Buddies..!!      
Its friday today and procrastination comes to peak as weekend start coming near. Fridays are most unproductive days of my work unless saturday is working 
I woke up and started my day with topics off the task. I started studying some topic of data structure as days of interviews are coming near I need 
to work hard for cracking them. After solving a few problems I took a sight of my project and decided the tasks for the day and I accept the 
work I did today is not worth a whole day but it is okay until it is not affecting my quality of work.     
Today I wondered how to make blobs and eventually landed at adobe illustrator and made a nearly same blob and completed my starting page and now main 
page is remaining. Lets see what would I need to do on monday itself and for now just live my life for weekend. But somewhere I know that I can't 
live my life without coding and wouldn't be able to keep myself away throughout the weekend. Health is something we can't compromise at any cost 
so we must keep our mental as well as physical health at a very high priority. So, lets see you on monday. Goodbye till then.   
#### Thank You   
###  Happy Weekend ðŸ¤©
