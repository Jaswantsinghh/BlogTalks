title: Day 11 - React Portal
---
Hi geeks!!   
Hope y'all be doing great. After this weekend I finally completed my previous task of ng-select clone and it also got approved today after I made it responsive. So, now a new task is given 
to me and level of hardness is intermediate. This time too I have to make a clone but clone of a modal window and a toast. You have been wondering h=what is toast, dont worry I also 
did'nt knew about it until today. So, a toast is something like a push window that appears on the top corner of the screen.      
So, I started with setting up the project. First of all I created a new react app and then installed node-sass  followed by configuration of eslint. After setting up the project, I 
gave a glance at the concept of React portal by watching a couple of videos and reading articles on internet. After this I got an idea about how I would be approaching the project. 
I created the frontpage and placed two buttons one for modal and other for toast. From tomorrow I will be working intensively on this task and my target is to complete it by tomorrow 
night only.
