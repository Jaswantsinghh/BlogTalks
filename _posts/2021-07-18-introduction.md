title: Introduction

Hey folks, My name is Jaswant Singh and I am a 2nd year computer science engineering undergrad. I am doing B.Tech in [Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana](https://gndec.ac.in). It is a 3-tier college known for extra-ordinary students and alumni. Our college has a vast and prestigious alumni support. Though being a tech enthusiast, I was never a geek during my school days. I was a naughty student with a ton of complaints a day. I always admired life of an army brat. But, during my last days of school I was not able to achieve something I dream for since initial days of my life. But I am kinda always motivated person and happy with where ever the destiny takes. So my destiny took me nowhere, it just placed me in front of a computer screen.    
As I said I am always motivated kinda person. So, this thing made me do better in computer science too. Though, there is a hell lot of space empty to be filled but still I have a decent start. Now, I have completed 2 years of B.Tech. (1.5 years in home) and college wanted us to do 4 weeks training either at college or at any industry.   
My mind was not ready to go with college one as I want to experience the real industry work. So, I applied at various companies but no one was ready to give training for just 1 month, they were asking for atleast 3 - 6 months.    
Now, I contacted one of my senior and told him this issue. He recommended me to talk to another senior and get a referral to [Ryaz.io](https://ryaz.io). It is a design led company which is handled by freelancers.
As I told earlier that our college is known for extra-ordinary alumni. Yes, you guessed it right. This company was started by seniors of my own college and many employees and trainees here are from same college. So, it is a moment of proud for me that I am working in a company of alumni of my own college.
So, I am excited to start my training here and will start writing daily blogs.   
Thanks for reading!  
#### Happy Starting :}
