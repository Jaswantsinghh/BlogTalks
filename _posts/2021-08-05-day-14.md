title: Day 14 - Task app soft design
---

Hey devs!!     
Hope you all been doing great. As I wrote yesterday my previous task is completed now and now I got an new one in which I have to clone a design template of task app. Level of task 
is pretty high this time but no worries when you have such a great mentors above you who are treating me as they are my friends. This task needs to apply css at a next level and 
another obstacle is that I do not know what fonts, dimension, color pallete etc are used as the source is an image. Leveling up is very much neccesary in whatever field you are working.
Today I worked on the first page of the design. I learnt how to design blobs and designing on photoshop or illustrator is giving me best insight right now. I am happy that I am facing 
new challenges and eventually learning great things.   
#### Thank Youhhh
### Happy Challenges! 🏋️‍♀️🏋️‍♂️🏋️‍♀️
