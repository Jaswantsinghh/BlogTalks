title: Day 13 - React portal

Hey buddy,     
Today I thought to give my early morning time to the task and it successfully increased my productivity. You know I completed this task with pushing my project to the github and hosted 
it using gh-pages eventually. Nothing can be more satisfying than completing the project. It is easy to start the project but keeping the motivation constant till the end of project 
is hard and for me it is impossible sometimes.     
But, this training is teaching me not only technical skills but soft skills too. I am glad that I came here for training and will suggest it to anyone going for training at first plate. 
Sorry for going off topics lets come to the task. I created the toast today and tried as much as I can to clone it and make it hard to find the difference. I have submitted the task 
for review and lets see what will be the feedback. It really doesn't matter whether feedback would be positive or negative, it is win-win situation in either case. So, lets take some 
quality sleep now and let the things be so for tomorrow morning.   
#### Gracias Devs
### Happy Completing ðŸ˜™
